## Sri Lankan Prayer Times

This app can show the prayer times/ salah times day-to-day.
Prayer times are calculated according to the teachings of the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and can vary according to different calculation methods.
We, Sri Lankans, follow the calculations of *'All Ceylon Jammiyathul Ulama'*.
So this app is designed to show the prayer times for Sri Lankan users only.

## Other Features.
This app includes the **'Read Quran'** page.
On this page, users can read the Quran and its meaning in the Tamil Language.
It has a beautiful UI and plenty of options that are easy to use.
